        <p>
          Hi there! I'm Seamus, a super-friendly Yorkshire Terrier and Bichon
          Frise mix, and let me tell you, I’m one happy doggo who loves everyone
          and everything! My hooman parents are Cillian (he’s from Dublin) and
          Kirsty (she’s from Liverpool). They spoil me rotten with tons of
          cuddles and attention—even when I’m being a bit barky and loud (hey,
          I’m just expressing myself!). My absolute favorite place in the world
          is Nefyn in North Wales!

          My hoomans have been going there for years, but I think I love it the
          most. There are so many beaches where I can run free, chase birds, and
          play with other dogs. Sometimes, my cousins Magic and Merlin are there
          too with their hoomans. Merlin and I are the “bad boys”—we get up to
          all kinds of mischief, while Magic just sits quietly with Molly and
          Hattie. Boring, right? 😂 When I'm not at the beach, you’ll find me at
          Penny Lane Dog Park, hanging out with my besties. Freddie (a
          wire-haired collie) and Tuco (I’m not sure what breed he is, but he’s
          a blast) are my regular buds. Alfie the whippet is fun too, but he’s
          so fast I can never quite catch him. 😢 My favorite, though, is Hope,
          a golden retriever. She’s not always there, but when she is, I know
          it’s going to be a good play day! My hoomans are thrilled too—they
          know I’ll be all tuckered out after. 😆
